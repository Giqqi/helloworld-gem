# HelloWorld

This is my first gem I build. I uploaded it just for me to document my work. Feel free to fork it ;o)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'hello_world'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install hello_world

## Usage

In your app you can type <%= HelloWorld.hello %> to output the "Hello World" text.
